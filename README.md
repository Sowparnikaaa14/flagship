### Project Description
A Web Platform where the user gets to know about their flag personality and get a suggested list of other people of their similar score.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most of the Gen-Z kids are not sure of what their flag personality is and what they are looking for in their partner. It gets even worse if they don't get the right match.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The User is given a series of real life situations or scenarios as questions. Based on the answers the user gets a percentage score on how much of a red or green flag they are.Also they get to connect with people of their similar score.
